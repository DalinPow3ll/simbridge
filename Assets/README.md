# simbridge
Simbridge is a simulated hackerspace.
This is a Unity3D-based simulation of a hackerspace inspired by a certain real-world place.
http://www.noisebridge.net/simbridge

It currently simulates a few objects:
* interactive books
* chairs
* blinky electronics kits
* the Conways Game of Life simulation on an LED sign.

Please join us in hacking on this level!
* add envrionmental detail models and textures.
* make new interactive objects.

If you would like to learn Unity3D code and art techniques to help, we'll teach you!
Come to Noisebridge.net/Gamebridge classes on Tuesdays at 8PM at Noisebridge Hackerspace 2169 Mission St. San Francisco CA
